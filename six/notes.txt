Values we need to extract
- The races: i.e time (ms)
- Current MAX distance (record)

Storing these as a hash map probably the best way to do lookups

Classes 
- RaceDay

Problem: Construct a method that iterates through each race (and its record) and counts the
number of different ways you can beat the record

Intuition: Start in the middle of the given race time, and work out from there, if you find
a strategy that is worse than the record, stop moving in that direction.

Methods we could build
- One Larger one that iterates through the races and their records, this one will handle
all the major functionality, by calling helper methods.
- Parsing the information given in the txt file.
- Calculate the distance based on time holding and travelling, might be a boolean return?
