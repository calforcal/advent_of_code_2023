Import the File through an initialize method
  - Parsing is simple here, can split each line on space, convert [1] to integer.
  - Leaves us with an array or 2 element arrays, one string (hand) and one int (bet)

Maybe there is Two Classes?
  - Game: Collection of all the hands, would handle things like sorting the hands etc.
  - Hand: Would store, "cards", bet, and type_of_hand (based on cards)

Hands Class
  - Initialize with a line(string)
  - Attribute/Method of #cards = parse string[0] iterate through each to turn string into
an array of numbers (annoying up front but should help sort later)
  - Attribute/Method of #bet = parse string[1] to int.
  - Attribute/Method of #hand_type - based on the cards given.

  Other Methods (Helpers)
    - check_hand: potentially map cards to a hash - maybe to store them as cards.
      - five_of_a_kind
      - four_of_a_kind
      - full_house
      - three_of_a_kind
      - two_pair
      - one_pair
      - high_card

    - compare_high_cards

Game Class
  - initialize with a file
  - convert file to @hands (array of hands objects)

  - sort_hands
  - sort_bucket_by_type
  - multiply_bet_by_rank
  - sum_rank_times_bet
